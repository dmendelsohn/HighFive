Robot.java --> put main state-system here
RobotConstants.java

packages-
	subsystems:
		drive_train
			moveStraight(double speed) -- speed from -1 to 1 -- negative = backwards
			turnClockwise(double degrees) 
			turnCounterClockwise(double degrees)
			stop()
		sensors -- incorporate these into other subsystems --> replace with vision
			gyroscope
			encoders
			ultrasonic
			infrared
			camera (maybe kinect)
			limit switches (maybe put limit switches into the each specific system)
		hoppers
			setPosition(int position) -1=left,0=center,1=right
		conveyor_belt
			moveBelt() -- only max speed
			encoder
			limit_switch 
	commands:

		use methods from each of the subsystems
		^^figure out as you go^^
